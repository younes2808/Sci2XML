## Files

- **app.py:**  
    This python file is a script that serves as the main interface for the web application. Its primary function is to extract, process, and display scientific papers in PDF format, leveraging GROBID for automatic metadata extraction. It also includes functions to update the XML text areas, cleaning the LaTeX formulas, reading and changing the environment file, process the classifier, and process the uploaded PDF. The main function has the following flow of process:
    This Python script serves as the core interface for the web application. Its primary purpose is to extract, process, and display scientific papers in PDF format, utilizing GROBID for automatic metadata extraction. Additionally, it includes various functions for updating XML text areas, cleaning LaTeX formulas, reading and modifying environment files, parsing the uploaded PDF file with GROBID, and process the classifier. The script follows a structured flow, with the main function performing the following steps:
    1. Initializes the UI with a custom design using st.markdown and applies the provided css.html file.
    2. Accepts a scientific paper in PDF format uploaded by the user.
    3. Sends the PDF to GROBID for metadata extraction and parsing.
    4. Displays the GROBID output both as a rendered PDF and an editable XML text.
    5. Allows the user to modify the XML, if necessary.
    6. Allows the user to include description of formulas, if desirable.
    7. Processes the XML by invoking the process_classifier, which classifies and interprets the document's structure.
    8. Displays the interpreted results in views for each element type as well an editable XML text.
    9. Enables the user to refine and download the final XML file.

- **css.html:**  
    This file is a block of custom CSS designed to style and modify the appearance of a Streamlit web app. It uses Streamlitâ€™s internal data-testid attributes to target specific UI components and override their default styles.

- **frontendmodule.py:**  
    This Python file is a script designed to interact with various web services (like Localtunnel, Ngrok, and Streamlit) to expose local applications or APIs to the public internet. It includes logging and environment variable handling for secure configuration. The script primarily performs two key tasks:
    1. Starting Streamlit: Runs a Streamlit app and tunnels the local port (8501) using either Localtunnel or Ngrok.
    2. Starting API: Starts a backend API service and exposes it to the public internet via the selected tunnel provider.
